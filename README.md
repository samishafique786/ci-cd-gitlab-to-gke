# CI/CD with Self-Hosted GitLab, CSC Cloud, and GKE

This repository will have a full CI/CD framework using a self-hosted GitLab instance deployed on the CSC - IT Center for Science cloud platform. It shows how automating the build, test, and deployment of a simple Node.js web application to Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) works. I made this project from scratch and thought that It would be a learning experience for me to build a full workflow to showcase my DevOps, sys admin and Linux skills.
